|  May, 2020   | <user name="YutaUra"/> developed the YCU Schedule to make it easier for students to participate in remote lectures at universities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  May, 2020   | The university's student affairs staff asked us to suspend the operation of the YCU schedule. After that, there was a lot of discussion about the operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  Sept, 2020  | After discussing it with the university's student affairs staff and others, it was decided that they might be able to approve our activities as a club.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Dec 17, 2020 | We set up Engine as an extension of the Python study group we were running in November 2019, and applied to become an official club of Yokohama City University.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
